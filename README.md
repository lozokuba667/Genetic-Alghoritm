# Genetic-Alghoritm
This repository contains student project related to Combinatorial Optimalization course. Specifically, it is implementation of Genetic Alghoritm to rebuild DNA sequence with information such as:

*Length of the original DNA sequence

*Length of the single oligonucleotide

*DNA spectrum

*Percentage of negative/positive errors

Following project is build on 3 files (2 custom modules and 1 main file):

*generator.py --> custom module containing functions resposnible for generating instances

*graph_sol.py --> custom module containing functions responsible for graph representation of first population

*ok_project.py --> main program and functions related to Genetic Alghoritm
